# Assuming a back to back topology with:
# PORT 0 - client port
# PORT 1 - server port

# Client port configuration
# Add the L3 interface on the client side
add tests l3_intf port 0 ip 10.0.0.1 mask 255.255.255.0

# Not required but add a default gw on the client side
add tests l3_gw port 0 gw 10.0.0.253

# Configure a TCP client test case (ID 0) on PORT 0
# from 10.0.0.1:[10001, 60000] to 10.0.0.253:[6001, 6200]

# Configure the timeout profile for test case ID 0 on PORT 0:
# initial-delay 0s start immediately
# uptime 20s
# downtime 10s
set tests timeouts port 0 test-case-id 0 init 0
set tests timeouts port 0 test-case-id 0 uptime 30

# Let the test run for 1h (3600s):
# criteria: run-time
set tests criteria port 0 test-case-id 0 run-time 3600

# Configure HTTP clients to perform a GET with body size 10 bytes for test case
# ID 0 on PORT 0:
set tests client http port 0 test-case-id 0 GET google.com /index.html req-size 10


# Server port configuration
# Add the L3 interface on the server side
add tests l3_intf port 1 ip 10.0.0.253 mask 255.255.255.0

# Not required but add a default gw on the server side
add tests l3_gw port 1 gw 10.0.0.1

# Configure a TCP server test case (ID 0) on PORT 1
# accepting connections on 10.0.0.253:[6001->6200]

# Configure HTTP servers to respond with 200 OK and a body size of 20 bytes
set tests server http port 1 test-case-id 0 200-OK resp-size 20


# Start the tests on PORT 1 (servers in this case)
start tests port 1

# Start the tests on PORT 0 (clients in this case)
