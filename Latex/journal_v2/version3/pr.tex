\section{System Model and Problem Formulation}
\subsection{System Model}
%This paper deals with the challenges of heterogeneous vehicular and cellular networks.
Assume we have two preallocated slices serving two services, eMBB, and URLLC services; 
eMBB Service consists of $U_{1}$ single-antenna user equipments (UEs) and URLLC service consists of $U_2$ UEs.
Assume our system consists of $K$, preallocated physical resource blocks (PRBs). Moreover, the system considers to have $M_s^{d}$ VNFs for the processing of O-DU, $M_s^{c}$ VNFs for the processing of O-CU-UP of eMBB and URLLC ($ s \in \{1, 2\}$). 
Virtual network functions (VNFs) are functional blocks of the system. Each VNF instance runs on a virtual machine (VM) using resources from the data centers. 
Moreover, we assume there is a cell with one multi-antenna O-RU that serves UEs.
\subsection{The Achievable Rate}
The eMBB services typically use more than a one-time slot. But URLLC services use part of a time slot (mini-slot) since it has short packet transmission. In addition, the URLLC must be punctured as soon as it has requested service as it requires very low latency.


%The SNR of $i^{th}$ UE requesting served at slice $ss \in \{1, 2\}$ is obtained from
%\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
%\rho_{u(s,i)} =  \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K_{s}}e_{u(s,i)}^k p_{u(s,i)}^{k}|{\bold{h}_{R,u(s,i)}^{H \: k}}|^2}{BN_0},
%\end{equation} 
%where $p_{u(s,i)}^{k}$ represents the transmission power allocated by O-RUs to $i^{th}$ UE served at slice $s$ on PRB $k$.
%${\bold{h}_{R,u(s,i)}^{k}} \in \mathbb{C}^{R}$ is the vector of channel gain of a wireless link from 
%O-RUs to the $i^{th}$ UE in $s^{th}$ slice. 
%Moreover, $e_{u(s,i)}^k \in \{0,1\}$ is a binary variable that illustrates whether PRB $k$ is assigned to the $i^{th}$ UE allocated to $s^{th}$ slice or not. 
%Also, $BN_0$ denotes the power of Gaussian additive noise.
%Moreover, we assume that each PRB is assigned to no more than one UEs. So we have
%\begin{equation}
%\sum_{s=1}^S \sum_{u=1}^{U_s} e_{u(s,i)}^k = 1
%\end{equation} 
The achievable data rate for the $i^{th}$ UE request eMBB slice can be written as $\mathcal{R}_{i}^{e}(t)$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\mathcal{R}_{i}^e(t) = \sum_{k = 1}^K e^k_i(t) B (1-\frac{n^k_i(t)}{S}) \log_2({1+\frac{p^k_i(t)h^k_i(t)}{B \times N_0}}),
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the bandwidth of RBs. Also, $B\times N_0$ denotes the power of Gaussian additive noise. 
Moreover, $e^k_i(t)\in \{0,1\}$ is a binary variable that illustrates whether PRB $k$ is assigned to the $i^{th}$ eMBB UE or not. 
$p^k_i(t)$ represents the transmission power allocated by O-RU to $i^{th}$ UE of eMBB using PRB $k$.
$h^k_i(t)$ is the channel gain of a wireless link from 
O-RU to the $i^{th}$ eMBB UE using $k^{th}$ PRB. In addition, $S$ is the total number of mini-slots of a PRB. 
Furthermore, $n^k_i(t)$ is the number of URLLC punctured slots. 

Since the blocklength in URLLC is finite, the achievable data rate for the $j^{th}$ UE request in the URLLC service, is not achieved from Shannon Capacity formula. So, for the short packet transmission the achievable data rate is approximated as follow
\begin{equation}\label{eq11}
\mathcal{R}_{j}^u(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^{U_1}\sum_{k=1}^K \frac{n^k_i(t)e^k_i(t)}{S \times U_2} B \log_2({1+\frac{p^k_j(t)h^k_j(t)}{B \times N_0}})- \zeta_{j}^k(t)), 
\end{equation}

where $\zeta_{j}^k(t) = \log_2({e})Q^{-1}(\epsilon) \sqrt{\frac{C_{j}^k(t)}{N_{j}^k(t)}})$
where $\epsilon$ is the transmission error probability, $Q^{-1}$ is the inverse of Q function (i.e., Gaussian),
$C_{j}^k(t) = 1 - \frac{1}{(1+\rho_{j}^k(t))^2}$ depicts the channel dispersion of UE $j$ of URLLC, puncturing mini-slots of PRB $k$ and
$N_{j}^k(t)$ represents the blocklength of it. Moreover, $\rho_{j}^k(t)=\frac{p^k_j(t)h^k_j(t)}{B \times N_0}$ is the SNR of UE $j$ in URLLC service. 

The channel gain is assumed to be known with errors, the imperfection of channel estimation is
modeled as follows
\begin{equation}
h^k_j(t) = \hat{h}^k_j(t) + \Delta h^k_j(t)
\end{equation}
Where, $\Delta h^k_j(t)$ denotes the estimation error with a Guassian distribution of
 \begin{equation}
\Delta h^k_j(t)\backsim \mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{\phi^k}^2),
\end{equation}
\subsection{Mean Delay}
In this part, the mean processing delay for each service is obtained.
Suppose the mean processing delay is depicted as $T_{\text{\text{proc}}}$,
\begin{equation}
T^{\text{proc}} =  T^{RU} + T^{DU} + T^{CU},
\end{equation}
Assume the packet arrival of URLLC UEs follows a Poisson process with arrival rate $\lambda_{j}$ for the $j^{th}$ UE.
Therefore, the mean arrival data rate of the O-CU-UP layer is $\alpha^C = \sum_{j=1}^{U_2}\lambda_{j}$.
Assume the mean arrival data rate for URLLC slice ($\alpha$) is approximately equal to the mean arrival data rate of the  the O-DU ($\alpha^D$). so $\alpha = \alpha^C \approx \alpha^D$,
Because the amount of data traffic transferred along the route (regardless of frame changes) is constant.
Since, by using Burkeâ€™s theorem, the mean arrival data rate of the second layer, which are processed in the first layer, is still poisson with rate $\alpha$.
It is assumed that there are load balancers in each layer for each service to divide the incoming traffic to VNFs equally. %\cite{frdl,luong2018novel,luong2018novel1}.
Suppose the baseband processing of each VNF is depicted as M/M/1 processing queue.
Each packet is processed by one of the VNFs of a slice. So, the mean delay for the URLLC slice in the O-DU,and the O-CU is modeled as M/M/1 queue, is formulated as follows, respectively \cite{SystemCostMinimization,luong2018joint,luong2018novel},
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T^{DU} &= \frac{1}{\mu^d - \alpha/{M^{d}}},\\
T^{CU} &= \frac{1}{\mu^c - \alpha/{M^{c}}},\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $M^{d}$,and $M^{c}$ are the variables that depict the number of VNFs in O-DU,and O-CU-UP, respectively. 
Moreover, $1/\mu^d$, and $1/\mu^c$ are the mean service time of the O-DU, and O-CU layers, respectively.
Besides, $\alpha$ is the  arrival rate which is divided
by load balancer before arriving to the VNFs. The arrival rate of each VNF in each layer for URLLC slice  is $\alpha/{M^{l}}$ $ l \in \{d,c\}$.

$T_{j}^{RU}$ is the mean transmission delay of the $j^{th}$ UE of the URLLC service on the wireless link.
 The arrival data rate of wireless link for each UE $j$ of URLLC service is $\lambda_j$
As a result, we have $\sum_{j = 1}^{U_2} \lambda_{j} = \alpha$.
Moreover, The service time of transmission queue for UE $j$ requesting URLLC service has
an exponential distribution with mean $1/R_{j}^u$ and can be modeled as a M/M/1 queue \cite{SystemCostMinimization,luong2018joint,luong2018novel}.
 
Therefore, the mean delay of the transmission layer for UE $j$ in URLLC slice is
\begin{equation}
 T_{j}^{RU} = \frac{1}{R_{j}^u - \lambda_{j}}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Reliability of URLLC}
As we know, UEs request URLLC services, require services with low latency.
For the M/M/1 system, the probability of the delay for URLLC service in the O-RU is as follow, 
\begin{equation}
P_r\{T_{j}^{RU} \geq T_{RU}^{max}\} = e^{-(R_{tot}^u - \alpha)T_{RU}^{max}}
\end{equation} 
where, $R_{tot}^u = \sum_{j =1}^{U_2}R_{j}^u$
Also, we do not consider the reliability for O-CU and O-DU.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
%In this system, the goal is to minimize the cost of the system.
%The total power cost of O-RUs for transmitting data to UE is depicted as follow
%\begin{equation}
%P_{tot} = \sum_{r=1}^{R}P_r
%\end{equation}
The optimization problem is formulated as follow

\begin{subequations} \label{mainP}
\begin{alignat}{4}
\max\limits_{ \boldsymbol{E}, \boldsymbol{N},\boldsymbol{M} } &  \sum_i R_{i}^e(t) - \eta \sum_j T^{\text{proc}, u}(t)       \ \\
\text{subject to} \quad  & \mathcal{R}_{i}^e(t) \geq  \mathcal{R}_{min}^e \quad \forall i \in U_1, \label{p1} \\
& Pr\{{R}_{i}^e(t) \leq {R}_{min}^e\}  \leq \epsilon \label{p2}\\
&T^{\text{proc}, u}_j(t)  \leq T_{min}^u  \quad \forall j \in U_2 \label{p3} \\
&Pr\{T^{\text{proc}, u}_j(t) \geq T_{min}^u\} \leq \epsilon  \quad \forall j \in U_2 \label{p4} 
\end{alignat}
\label{constraints}
\end{subequations}
where, \eqref{p2}, supports the reliability of eMBB while puncturing the URLLC.
