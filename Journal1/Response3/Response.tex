This paper aims to optimize the resource utilization of a downlink O-RAN system to develop an isolated network slicing outline for the three 5G service classes.
We use mathematical methods to decompose and convexify the problem and solve it using hierarchical algorithms.
%Our paper focuses on the multi-service resource management of the RAN slicing in an open and flexible O-RAN architecture.}
%In this paper, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:c11}, the downlink of the O-RAN system is studied.
 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We examine the problem of radio resource allocation and VNF activation within the O-RAN architecture.
Based on the three types of 5G service classes, i.e., eMBB, URLLC and mMTC, and their corresponding QoS requirements and service priorities, we formulate a problem for allocating baseband resources such as power, physical resource blocks (PRBs), O-RUs, and activating VNFs to maximize the weighted throughput of the O-RAN.
\item We propose a two-step resource management algorithm for solving the optimization problem.
In the first step, we reformulate and simplify the problem so as to find an upper and lower bound for the number of activated VNFs. Moreover, we use the Lagrangian function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to obtain the optimal power and PRB allocation. In the second step, the problem of O-RU association is converted to a multiple knapsack problem and solved by a greedy algorithm.
\item We provide insights into the complexity of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate their convergence. Additionally, we analyze the feasibility region of our problem and introduce a fast algorithm to check its feasibility numerically.
\item We show via numerical results that the proposed algorithm outperforms two baseline schemes, in terms of achievable data rate. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm performs close to the optimal solution in low-interference conditions.

%\subsection{State Of The Arts}
Network slicing is a key technology in 5G wireless systems. Specifically, network slicing provides the isolation of network resources into slices, e.g., via core slicing and/or radio access network (RAN) slicing, for serving multiple and heterogeneous service classes [1]–[3]. There are three main service classes in 5G, namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-to-machine communications (mMTC). Depending on their corresponding quality of service (QoS) requirements, each service is assigned to a slice of the network.
For instance, the eMBB service demands high capacity and throughput,  e.g., 8K video streaming and immersive gaming. Meanwhile, the URLLC service, leveraged, e.g., by autonomous vehicles, Tactile Internet, and remote surgery services, is concerned with providing ultra-reliable and low-latency connectivity. Finally, mMTC services require connectivity for a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that transmit small payloads [4]–[6].
%\cite{dogra2020survey,kassab2018coexistence,alsenwi2021intelligent,SL}.}

Unfortunately, the existing radio access network (RAN) architecture still lacks adequate flexibility and openness to manage these demands for various services simultaneously. In view of this, a new RAN paradigm, called open RAN (O-RAN), which is schematically represented in Fig. 1, is introduced to deal with these issues.
%This paper considers several user equipments (UEs) requesting one of these types of services with different QoS in the O-RAN architecture. We want to study RAN slicing technology and the isolation between slices in this system to evaluate the performance of various services.
%This paper aims to design a RAN slicing technology for the O-RAN architecture. 
%O-RAN offers machine learning techniques based on the requirement for an intelligent wireless network for the next generation of RAN systems. The two logical nodes, RIC-Non Real-Time (which is placed in Orchestration and Automation node) and RIC-Near Real-Time, implement the algorithms for network intelligence

A key feature of the O-RAN architecture is that the hardware is disaggregated from the software, leading to network function virtualization (NFV). Additionally, each component is implemented as a virtual network function (VNF), the system function block in NFV, that can be deployed on a virtual machine (VM) or container [7],[8].
As a result, some O-RAN components defined in Section III, such as user plane function (UPF), O-RAN central unit (O-CU), O-RAN distributed unit (O-DU), and RAN intelligent controller (RIC)-near real-time, are virtualized and implemented as VNFs.

\textbf{\noindent Comment3:} `` Furthermore, it is surprising how the Introduction does not contain a single research challenge. Why is the problem relevant at all? Why do you even need to study this problem and why is it hard to solve? ''\\

\vspace*{-1\baselineskip}
\noindent \textbf{Response:\\}
We add the motivation subsection and answer these questions in it. Below we rewrite this section.

The problem of finding the optimal resource allocation, independently of the specific RAN technology, is vital for reducing the cost of the system and improving the QoS of the user equipments (UEs). In case of 5G systems, there are many related significant challenges such as interference alignment, limited capacity of fronthaul links, energy restrictions on virtual machines, etc [2],[9],[10]. 

Many studies have investigated resource allocation in cloud RAN (C-RAN) by considering the power, data rate and delay limitations of a single service. Due to the contemporary need to serve services with different QoS simultaneously, e.g., as in 5G and beyond, this architectural model is inefficient. In this regard, the O-RAN architecture has emerged as a flexible, layered, and modular design architecture that can simultaneously support multiple services at a lower cost. Nevertheless, RAN slicing in the O-RAN architecture still faces various challenges. 
One of the fundamental problems lies in attaining a balance between different services with different QoS, resource requirements, and priorities [1],[11]–[13].  
%\textcolor{MidnightBlue}{Since 5G defines different services with different QoS, we need to analyze the resource allocation for each 5G service, using RAN slicing to guarantee the QoS for them.
%Consequently, we consider the O-RAN architecture, the new generation of RAN architecture that can implement RAN slicing for different 5G services. 
%We investigate the problem of resource allocation in the O-RAN architecture for the three services defined in the 5G with different QoS serving simultaneously.}

The purpose of this paper is to design a system in the O-RAN architecture to support the three types of 5G services, namely, eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC via network slicing and resource allocation. Specifically, we aim to maximize the total achievable data rate and satisfy the minimum achievable data rate for eMBB services while meeting the URLLC requirements in the presence of numerous low-power IoT devices.

2) “ Different services need to consider varying QoS conditions, including delay, power, and throughput.”
3) “The main problem is mixed-integer non-linear programming that is extremely difficult to solve.”

\textbf{\noindent Comment6:} `` Regarding the Reviewer’s comment with respect to the network slice management, whereas the authors have introduced the 4 stages of the life cycle of a network slice, the connection to their approach is very vague. It is still not clear how this process is achieved and how it is linked to their method. I was expecting at least a connection or introduction to Fig.1 where the system is shown. Additionally, more information with respect to the interaction with the system would have been required in that regard. ''\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\vspace*{-1\baselineskip}
\noindent \textbf{Response:\\}
We add the following part to the slice management section.

In the preparation phase, firstly, the evaluation of requirements is considered. Therefore, In this phase, we need an algorithm to estimate the number of UEs and UE traffic in the system at different times. Moreover, based on this estimation, we need to evaluate resources, including the optimal number of VNFs for each slice, the optimal number of PRBs for each slice, and the analysis of power allocation. In this phase, we can use our algorithm after estimating the system's traffic.
 As shown in figure 1, we have three different slices for eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. For each slice, the system must prepare MAC/RLC protocols for O-DU, PDCP/SDAP protocols for O-CU, UPF, SMF, and AMF. Moreover, O-RU, high PHY in O-DU, and O-CU-CP are shared between slices. Thus, we do not require estimating and preparing for the share environments and platforms in the network slicing cycles. 
After evaluating, assessing, and preparing the resources and environments for each slice, the commissioning phase is started. In this phase, the slices are created based on the previous phase. If the evaluation changes, the slice's resources can be modified.
We can use our algorithm to assign resources to the services in the operation phase.
If we need to remove a slice or any service is not used in a zone, and we need to remove the corresponding slice, the unshared resources are removed in the decommissioning phase.

\textbf{\noindent Comment6:} ``With respect to the convergence time of the algorithm, the Reviewer had made a suggestion to the authors to include it in the current version of the manuscript, yet the authors do not seem to have done that. The authors’ response points to Fig. 11. However if one looks at Fig.11 carefully, understands that only the Aggregate throughput is shown there. Even if one considers the Section III-C1 and III-C2 that the authors demonstrate as their convergence analysis and proof, there is no evidence or clarification of any delay value with respect to their algorithm’s convergence. On the one hand it is very beneficial to have a mathematical proof that the algorithm converges. On the other hand, it is equally important to portray these findings with numerical values. In any case, this is not applicable in the current version of the manuscript. ''\\
